# Bookmark (startup bookmark)

>  main purpose!

I'm really bored with startup extensions that are just like that, they only offer images that are actually unnecessary, and most people and of course I only need a simple appearance and lots of shortcut widgets, that's the main goal I made this repo, actually it's not difficult to make and this is still static, I'm still developing it (my knowledge hasn't reached the dynamic website btw) but the main thing is that it uses files only and it's very easy for everyone to operate this file

## Setup Instruction

clone this repo and edit that file step by step instruction on below this

1. clone ts repo
```bash
    cd Document/
    git clone https://github.com/takathena/bookmark.git

3. after that open the files on browser and copy the file address, like this for example
```bash

```
4. go to browser setting and go to the `On startup` select `Open a specific page or set of pages` If you have pasted the file address (the HTML one)
